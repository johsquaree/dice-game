# DICE-GAME
A chance game where two rival teams aim to find an integer that is neither positive nor negative by selecting a card each...

# Game and Rules
Two teams are required for the game.

Each team is given 10 cards.

The cards are arranged in order, and each card is assigned an index number sequentially.

Each card has a randomly written number on the back.

The numbers on the back of the cards are entirely random.

All cards can either have the same number or completely different numbers.

# Gameplay
Each team selects one card.

If the number on the back of the selected card is neither positive nor negative, the team that owns that card wins the game.

If the number on the back of the opened card is neither positive nor negative, move on to the next step.

The number on the back of the opened card gives the index number of the new card to be opened.

A new card is opened with the new index number.

This process continues until an integer that is neither positive nor negative is found.

If neither team can reach an integer that is neither positive nor negative, the game ends.

The maximum number of moves is five. In other words, five cards are opened, and if an integer that is neither positive nor negative is not found, the game ends in a draw.
